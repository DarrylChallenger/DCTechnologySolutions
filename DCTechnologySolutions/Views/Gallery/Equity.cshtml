                The web site for EQUITY is currently under development. It will complement the Facebook platform and provide a portal to the Mosaic,

                The EQUITY Organizing Committee chose Facebook as the platform to debut the EQUITY Project. I built the page to
                share information about the project and to test the concept of EQUITY with friends and family. I added many video
                interviews from the January 2017 Women's March in Washington, DC. Moving forward, it will be one of the primary
                advertising channels. Posts are updated regularly, and EQUITY's events will be also posted there.

                I joined the EQUITY Organizing Committee as Project Manager, coordinating meetings and activities.
                I worked on the Facebook page and am collecting requirements for the web site and <strong>DAMN</strong>.
                I am also building the web site and expanding the social media footprint.
