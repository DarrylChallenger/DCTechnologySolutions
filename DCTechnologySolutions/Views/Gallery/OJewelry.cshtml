            This client works with jewelers to manage thier inventory and control their costs. She had many manual and paper-based processes,
            and found that she was not able to handle more clients.
        </p>
        <p>
            The OJewelry application brought the inventory system online and helped solve scaling issues:
            The application supports bulk-loading of a jewelers pieces, organizing items into assortments, and component cost management.
            She is able to track the location of pieces when jewelers send them out for display.
            Inventory, Location, and Vendor reports are available online can can be exported to Excel; manufacturing components can be imported from Excel.
            Vendor and User Management is supported with built-in administrative functions - different users are authorized to see only their specific data.
